## Project: C - Search Algorithms
### Authors: [@Ihansen225](https://www.github.com/Ihansen225)
Search algorithms research and testing exercises.
### Tools used:
- [Vim editor for Linux](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)

### Learning objectives:
#### General
-   What is a search algorithm
-   What is a linear search
-   What is a binary search
-   What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
