## Project: C - Variables, if, else, while
### Authors: [@Ihansen225](https://www.github.com/Ihansen225)
Variables and basic loops exercises in C.
### Tools used:
- [Vim editor for Linux](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)

### Learning objectives:
#### General
-   What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
-   What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
-   What the the relational operators and how to use them
-   What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
-   What are the boolean operators and how to use them
-   How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
-   How to use comments
-   How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
-   How to assign values to variables
-   How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
-   How to use the `while` loop
-   How to use variables with the `while` loop
-   How to print variables using `printf`
-   What is the `ASCII` character set
-   What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`
