## Project: C - Hello, World
### Authors: [@Ihansen225](https://www.github.com/Ihansen225)
Repository containing low-level programming exercises in C
### Tools used:
- [Vim editor for Linux](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)

### Learning objectives:
#### General

-   Why C programming is awesome
-   Who invented C
-   Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
-   What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
-   What is an entry point
-   What is `main`
-   How to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`
-   How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
-   How to compile using `gcc`
-   What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
-   What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
-   How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
-   How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program
