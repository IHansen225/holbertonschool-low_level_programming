## Project: C - Preprocessor
### Authors: [@Ihansen225](https://www.github.com/Ihansen225)
Preprocessor research and testing exercises.
### Tools used:
- [Vim editor for Linux](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)

### Learning objectives:
#### General
-   What are macros and how to use them
-   What are the most common predefined macros
-   How to include guard your header files

### Project files:
