## Project: C - More functions, more nested loops
### Authors: [@Ihansen225](https://www.github.com/Ihansen225)
Advanced exercises containing loops inside loops.
### Tools used:
- [Vim editor for Linux](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)

### Learning objectives:
#### General
-   What are nested loops and how to use them
-   What is a function and how do you use functions
-   What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
-   What is a prototype
-   Scope of variables
-   What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
-   What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`
